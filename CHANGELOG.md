# Moka &mdash; Change Log

## Version 0.6.0 (Unreleased)

### Added

- Add support for size aware admission policy. ([#24][gh-pull-0024])
- Add support for unbound cache. ([#24][gh-pull-0024])

### Changed

- Change `get_or_try_insert_with` to return a concrete error type rather
  than a trait object. ([#23][gh-pull-0023])


## Version 0.5.1

### Changed

- Replace a dependency cht v0.4 with moka-cht v0.5. ([#22][gh-pull-0022])


## Version 0.5.0

### Added

- Add `get_or_insert_with` and `get_or_try_insert_with` methods to `sync` and
  `future` caches. ([#20][gh-pull-0020])


## Version 0.4.0

### Fixed

- **Breaking change**: Now `sync::{Cache, SegmentedCache}` and `future::Cache`
  require `Send`, `Sync` and `'static` for the generic parameters `K` (key),
  `V` (value) and `S` (hasher state). This is necessary to prevent potential
  undefined behaviors in applications using single-threaded async runtime such as
  Actix-rt. ([#19][gh-pull-0019])

### Added

- Add `invalidate_entries_if` method to `sync`, `future` and `unsync` caches.
  ([#12][gh-pull-0012])


## Version 0.3.1

### Changed

- Stop skeptic from having to be compiled by all downstream users. ([#16][gh-pull-0016])


## Version 0.3.0

### Added

- Add an unsync cache (`moka::unsync::Cache`) and its builder for single-thread
  applications. ([#9][gh-pull-0009])
- Add `invalidate_all` method to `sync`, `future` and `unsync` caches.
  ([#11][gh-pull-0011])

### Fixed

- Fix problems including segfault caused by race conditions between the sync/eviction
  thread and client writes. (Addressed as a part of [#11][gh-pull-0011]).


## Version 0.2.0

### Added

- Add an asynchronous, futures aware cache (`moka::future::Cache`) and its builder.
  ([#7][gh-pull-0007])


## Version 0.1.0

### Added

- Add thread-safe, highly concurrent in-memory cache implementations
  (`moka::sync::{Cache, SegmentedCache}`) with the following features:
    - Bounded by the maximum number of elements.
    - Maintains good hit rate by using entry replacement algorithms inspired by
      [Caffeine][caffeine-git]:
        - Admission to a cache is controlled by the Least Frequently Used (LFU) policy.
        - Eviction from a cache is controlled by the Least Recently Used (LRU) policy.
    - Expiration policies:
        - Time to live
        - Time to idle
